# 1: Git Down With Markdown

Welcome to the wonderful world of Markdown! We've already discovered how Markdown can be a nice shortcut for simple HTML. We can do headings, lists, links, and even images (have you figured out how yet?)

## Primary Objective
Using Markdown, create a file called `index.md` inside this folder. Then, create a short biography page that includes details about your personal history, interests, family, and anything else you'd like to add.

## Secondary Objectives
### Images
Use images to spice up your Markdown!

### MD â†’ HTML
Can you figure out how to turn Markdown into HTML? Maybe there's an Atom plugin that will help!
