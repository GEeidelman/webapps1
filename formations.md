![4-4-2](/images/4-4-2.jpg)[Website with soccer-formations](https://www.football-bible.com/soccer-info/football-formations.html)
* Very basic Formation
* Four defenders(two center-backs and two full backs), four midfielders(two central midfielders, two side midfielders), and two forwards
* One of two forwards plays outside penalty box
* This makes the opposing team thing that they are playing a 4-4-1-1 Formation(Will talk about later)
* The advantage is having an extra player that can help the striker attack without having to wait for midfield support.
* Also, the two side midfielders and two fullbacks allow a team to cover the space on the sides in defense and utilize it in offense.
* This is most common in: Bundesliga
